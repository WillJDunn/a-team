-- IMPORTANT: all existing data for these tables will be DELETED. This is required because
--   these explicitly state ID column values which might otherwise be in use

-- It's basically got everything we need for managing our own project:
--   users table has IDs for each of us with password "foo"
--   There is a project called Team A. This project has a board called Development
--   Board Development has items for each of our user stories (as we listed in our previous project presentation)
--   There's also a bit of other data not for our project just test stuff
